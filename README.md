# TLLM

This is my repository dedicated to the Tiny Large Language Model (TLLM). In this project, I aim to implement a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch, starting with a compact version known as TLLM. This README.md file serves as an introduction and guide to navigating this repository.

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and understanding. These models have been instrumental in a wide range of applications, from chatbots to machine translation to content generation. However, creating and training these models can be resource-intensive and complex.

The Tiny Large Language Model (TLLM) project is an exploration into building a scaled-down, more accessible version of a large language model. By creating a compact implementation, this project aims to:

- Provide a clear and concise example of a language model architecture.
- Enable developers and researchers to experiment with LLMs on smaller hardware and budgets.
- Facilitate understanding of the inner workings of LLMs.

## Implementation

In this repository, you will find the following key components:

1. **Model Architecture**: The `model.py` file contains the code for the TLLM architecture. This is where the core of the language model is implemented.

2. **Training Data**: To train the TLLM, you can find a sample dataset in the `data/` directory. You can replace this with your own dataset or use a larger one when available.

3. **Training Code**: The `train.py` script is responsible for training the TLLM using the specified dataset. It includes parameters for training configuration and hyperparameters.

4. **Inference**: Once trained, you can use the `inference.py` script to generate text using the TLLM. This can be helpful for text generation tasks.

## Usage

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/atabakp/tllm.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies by running:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Customize the model architecture, training data, and hyperparameters to fit your specific use case.

4. Train the TLLM using the training script:

   ```
   python train.py
   ```

5. After training, you can generate text using the TLLM:

   ```
   python inference.py
   ```
